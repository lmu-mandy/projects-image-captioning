# Image Captioning Using Neural Networks

The image captioning code used in this project was adopted from Hvass Lab at https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials from his notebook 22_Image_Captioning.ipynb .  

The rest of the image captioning code (Persson model) was adapted from the Persson code found here: https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/more_advanced/image_captioning  
Additionally, more notes on running the files and further details on Andrew's part of the project can be found at this repo link: https://github.com/ABruneel04/NLP_Final_Project
